### READ ME FIRST

This directory contains course-related contents. More specifically it contains python-review contents & lecture interpretaion notes.

Every lecture that I attend, I will summarize my interpretation and upload affter the lecture is over. This means that you will likely be able to see new notes here on the lecture days. There will be days where I will not be able to make it to lecture, if you want to collaborate on contributing to this repository, please contact me hanchoi@ucdavis.edu.

In python-review directory, we can find review materials for basic to intermediate python programming. You can find the list of concepts that I went over by directly accessing the directory, or click here.

Any file within this directory is a lecture interpretation note. It is personal interpretation so I suggest that you do not fully depend on it rather you should first refer to the actual class note and test on your own whether how you interpreted a certain concept is good or not. Although the concepts and contents are motivated by each lecture in our ECS 170 Summer II 2022 course, I WILL NOT copy & paste any content from the actual lecture notes written by professor. I do not like copying and pasting. Rather I love to interpret in my own words and learn to describe to others in my own words. This means that this notes are not for you if you are looking for exact contents that professor writes in actual lecture notes.

### Before Getting Started

Before getting started, we can first review some of the concepts & tools that will help us throughout the lecture interpretation notes.

**Technologies**

According to the class objectives, we will be using Google Colaboratory which is primarily based off from python programming language. On top of this, we will be using python dependencies (libraries) including **PyTorch** and **scikit-learn**.

- [ ] Setting up python environment via Google Colab can be found [_To Be Updated_](#).
- [ ] Reviewing python programming materials can be read from `PYTHON_REVIEW.md` file in this directory or click [here](./PYTHON_REVIEW.md)
- [ ] Installing useful dependencies on Google Colab's notebooks can be found [_To Be Updated_](#)

**Testing Programs (OPTIONAL)**

This IS NOT from the lecture notes, but my personal opinion based on professional advices & experiences.

In programming, what we mean by **test** is quite different from the exams or quizzes that we are assigned in classroom settings.

What we mean by **test** is to verify that the program that **WE** construct behave as **WE** expect without any unexpected incidents. In other words, **tests** are used to pick out some of the issues, if any, that we as programmers DID NOT expect when writing programs and also verifying that it works just like we expected.

Even if the class does not require us to test our programs that we write for our projects, assignments, and such, it is a really good practice to know the importance of testing our programs before we submit or we make it available to others.

Unless the professor guides us through some of these testing tools (in future lectures), I will be introducing & using two main tools to test every program that I write. So if you'd like you can also learn more about them. I will include the links below.

- [ ] Example cases where testing can really make your program better can be read in `TESTING.md` file in this directory or click [here](./TESTING.md)
