    "# Queue Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement two types of queues in this module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Queue, which represents a simple queue with basic prorperties and operational methods\n",
    "2. Priority Queue, which is based off of Queue but with additional properties & operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue is an abstract data structure which has this trait called **FIFO** which stands for 'first in first out'. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we can think of a list of elements implemented using Queue data structure, the ways that new element can be inserted, or old element can be removed from the list has specific constraint that whatever was inserted into the list first should be removed first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we must use the first element of the list when operating on removal and last element position when operating on inserting, it is pretty normal to say that this data structure is open in both front and back. In our case, our list has front and back. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Front** is the element in line to be removed when invoked. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Back** is the element to slide to left when a new element is ready to be inserted at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue Methods (Operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, we can easily tell that Queue data structure should have some internal methods to **remove** and **add** element. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Queue, removing can be interchangeable with **dequeue**, and adding (inserting) can be interchangeable with **enqueue**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When **dequeing** without any pre defined or customized restrictions, we can simply remove an item from the list without having another information other than 'what is the element first in line', which we should already have stored in our structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **enqueing**, or adding a new item to the list, we need one additional information on top of where the last element is, which is to know the incoming item itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these concepts above, we can implement Queue as a class object which stores a list of items, front, and back. Also, when operating on **enqueue**, we can simply that the item as a parameter value of our enqueue function to store that into our structure's list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the code blocks will be combined to implement our data structure **Queue**. To make our code more readable for a lot of you, I will be using type hinting to let you figure out on your own what the types refer to in each class instances, methods, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simplicity, the list stored in our Queue data structure will have its elements within the bound of number type, which includes integers, floats, and complex numbers.\n"
